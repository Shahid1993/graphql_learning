# Part 4: Querying with Directives

In some cases you may need to provide options to alter GraphQLâ€™s execution behavior in ways field arguments cannot, such as conditionally including or skipping a field *if* certain criteria are met. Directives enable us to do just that.

Right now GraphQL comes with two directives-
`@skip` and `@include`, but future extensions to it may include more, such as `@defer`, `@stream` and `@live`.

## `@skip`

The `@skip` directive may be provided for fields or fragments, and allows for conditional exclusion as described by the if argument.

In this example `experimentalField` will be queried only if the variable `$someTest` has a value of `false`.

```
query myQuery($someTest: Boolean) {
  experimentalField @skip(if: $someTest)
}

```

## `@include`

The `@include` directive may be provided for fields or fragments, and allows for conditional inclusion during execution as described by the if argument.

In this example `experimentalField` will be queried only if the variable `$someTest` has a value of `true`.

```
query myQuery($someTest: Boolean) {
  experimentalField @include(if: $someTest)
}

```
Note: if both the @skip and @include directives are provided, the field  must be queried only if the @skip condition is false and the @include condition is true.

> If you are still with me, you have probably noticed the use of variables (`$someTest`) in GraphQL queries. *Well, does this work? How does it work? Like view templates? What's the benefit of writing our queries this way? How do you assign values to these variables? How do you send these queries to server? By assigning values in place? Or the values are passed seperately?*

As a working example, we can use this simple nodejs app to post queries to an endpoint that accepts GraphQL queries.

(*We have used some ES2015 goodies here, if something doesn't feel familiar please check the new features of ES2015. We are using `Babel` to automatically transpile our ES2015 code to ES5, since nodejs doesn't have all the necessary parts in its core to natively run ES2015, yet.*)

In the terminal:
```
npm i babel request
touch index.js server.js

```

Put the following in `index.js`. **This is the entry point of our app. We'll run this file with node**:
```
// By requiring `babel/register`, all of our successive requires will be transpiled by Babel.
require('babel/register');
require('./server.js');
```

In our `server.js` file:
```js
import {request} from 'request';

const SERVER_URL = 'https://graphql.example.com/';

let query = `
  query myQuery($someTest: Boolean) {
  experimentalField @include(if: $someTest)
}
`;

let params = {
  someTest: true
};

//Unlike REST, GraphQL doesn't specify which HTTP Verb to use.
//POST seems to be a right fit here.
request.post(SERVER_URL, {
  query,
  params
}, (err, res, body) => {
  // Handle response
});
```

This example is here just to show how to post a GraphQL query programmatically in nodejs. Of course the same can be achieved with `curl`, `Postman`, `httpie`, `XMLHttpRequest` or the modern `fetch` API in browsers. If you are using React (you probably are using that), Relay will take care of it.

Now what about the GraphQL server that'll process the query? We haven't said anything about how to write a GraphQL server yet. Let's start that in the next part.
