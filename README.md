## [Why GraphQL is the future of APIs](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-graphql-is-the-future-of-apis-6a900fb0bc81)
  GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook in 2012 and released publicly in 2015. It has been gaining a lot of traction. It has been adopted by a lot of big companies such as Spotify, Facebook, GitHub, NYTimes, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.  
  
  __Problems with RESTful API Design :__
  1. Poor performance
  2. A lot of endpoints
  3. Over-fetching or under-fetching of data
  4. Shipping another version every time we need to include or remove something
  5. Difficulty understanding APIs  
  
  __Why GraphQL is the future?__ 
  1. Single endpoint   - makes your API self-documented
  2. You fetch only the data you need   - improves the performance of your API
  3. Makes it easy to start building APIs and be consistent
  4. GraphQL is an agnostic query language which means you can use it with any language. At the time of writing this tutorial, GraphQL has support for more than 12 languages.
  5. An open source query language

## Plan

I intend to use these documents to make workshopper lessons. Any kind of contributions are welcome, more if you feel like adding tasks and test suits in the workshopper.
