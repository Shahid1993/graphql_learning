# Part 3: Querying with Field Aliases & Fragments

We have seen basic queries with parameters. Let's get into deeper water.

## Field Aliases

Consider the GraphQL query from the previous section:

```
// Request
query FetchUser {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}

// Response:
{
  data: {
    user: {
      name: "Lee Byron"
    }
  }
}
```

What if you need to fetch multiple users in a single query? You already have `user` as the property of `data` object, how would you fit another user there?

`Field Aliases` can be handy in these cases. You can give your fields any valid name you want, and the response will match that query. (`user` is called a `field` here, you remember that from the previous lesson, right?)

```
// Request
query FetchLeeAndSam {
  lee: user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
  sam: user(id: "2") {
    name
  }
}
```

The `field` name `user` is still the same, you are just instructing GraphQL server to provide Lee's data and Sam's data in their separate keys.

```
// Response:
{
  data: {
    lee: {
      name: "Lee Byron"
    },
    sam: {
      name: "Sam"
    }
  }
}
```

By the way, using a comma between `field`s in a GraphQL query is optional. You can use them between `lee` and `sam` if that makes you comfortable, like this:

```
// Request
query FetchLeeAndSam {
  lee: user(id: "1") {
    name
  },
  sam: user(id: "2") {
    name
  }
}
```

## Fragments

Now imagine your product manager suddenly came and asked to include Lee and Sam's email addresses to the UI. We could ask for the new data with this query of course:

```
// Request
query FetchLeeAndSam {
  lee: user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
  }
  sam: user(id: "2") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

We can already see that we are repeating ourselves. Since we have to add new fields (email) to both parts of the query, things are looking a bit odd. Instead, we can extract out the common fields into a `fragment`, and reuse the fragment in the query, like this:

```
// Request
query FetchWithFragment {
  lee: user(id: "1") {
    ...UserFragment
  }
  sam: user(id: "2") {
    ...UserFragment
  }
}

fragment UserFragment on User {
  name
  email
}

```

> This `...` is called the spread operator. If you are familiar with the new features of ES6/ES2015, you already have used similar syntax there.
>
> The `on User` tells us that the `UserFragment` can only be applied to the `User` type. I already gave you a hint that GraphQL is strongly-typed, we'll go through the details of the type system later.

Both of those queries give this result:

```
// Response:
{
  data: {
    lee: {
      name: "Lee Byron",
      email: lee@example.com
    },
    sam: {
      name: "Sam",
      email: sam@example.com
    }
  }
}
```

The `FetchLeeAndSam` and `FetchWithFragment` queries will both get the same result, but `FetchWithFragment` is less verbose and less repetitive; if we wanted to add more fields, we could add it to the common fragment rather than copying it into multiple places.

## Inline Fragment

There is another similar thing called `inline fragments`, which as you might have guessed, can be defined inline to queries. This is done to conditionally execute fields based on their runtime type.

In the following example, based on the type of the show, we will get:

- sequels for the "The Matrix" show, which is of the `Movie` type
- episodes for the "Mr. Robot" show, which is of the `Tvshow` type.

```
query inlineFragmentTyping {
  shows(titles: ["The Matrix", "Mr. Robot"]) {
    title
    ... on Movie {
      sequel {
        name
        date
      }
    }
    ... on Tvshow {
      episode {
        name
        date
      }
    }
  }
}
```


There are other ways to conditionally modify a query. `Directive` plays the key role in that and we are going to talk about them in the next part.
