#Contributing to this repository:
Any contributions are welcome. Feel free to send pull request with improvements in spelling and grammar to better examples and descriptions.

##Priority:
If you are looking for what would help most, please start with the workshopper, add tasks and tests to it. If you are new to workshopper, you can get a nice guideline [here](http://lin-clark.com/blog/2014/07/01/authoring-nodejs-workshopper-lessons/).

##Styling:
I've added `.editorconfig` file to this project to help with consistency. Your favorite text editor probably already has a plugin for it [here](http://editorconfig.org/), if not already installed.

I'd prefer examples in ES2015 syntax.

##Credits:
I'm willing mention all contributors in the root README file. Your name will be mentioned in the `learning-graphql` npm package if you have directly contributed there.
